The Binary Decision

The if statement selects a statement for execution 
based on the value of a Boolean expression. In the 
following example a Boolean flag flagCheck is set 
to true and then checked in the if statement. 
The output is: The flag is set to true.

bool flagCheck = true;
if (flagCheck)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The flag is set to true.");
}
else 
{
    Console.WriteLine("The flag is set to false.");
}
