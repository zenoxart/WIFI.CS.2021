The Counting Loop

The for loop executes a statement or a block of 
statements repeatedly until a specified expression evaluates 
to false. The for loop is handy for iterating over arrays 
and for sequential processing. In the following example, 
the value of int i is written to the console and i is 
incremented each time through the loop by 1.

Example

// for loop
using System;
class ForLoopTest 
{
    static void Main() 
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i);
        }
    }
}
